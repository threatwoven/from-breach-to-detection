# From Attack to Detection – Purple Team Simulation

## Scenario Overview
This simulated scenario demonstrates how an attacker progresses
from initial access to detection within a corporate environment.

## Initial Access
The attacker gains access through compromised user credentials
obtained via a phishing campaign.

## Attack Progression
- Credential reuse across internal systems
- Lateral movement using legitimate administrative tools
- Attempted privilege escalation within Active Directory

## Detection Gaps
- Lack of visibility into abnormal authentication patterns
- Insufficient alerting on lateral movement activity
- Delayed detection of privilege escalation attempts

## Blue Team Perspective
Security monitoring focuses on perimeter defenses,
resulting in limited detection of internal attacker behavior.

## Purple Team Recommendations
- Improve authentication telemetry and anomaly detection
- Enhance logging and monitoring of lateral movement techniques
- Conduct regular Purple Team simulations to align attack paths with detection rules

## Outcome
Aligning offensive techniques with defensive detection
reduces attacker dwell time and strengthens security posture.
