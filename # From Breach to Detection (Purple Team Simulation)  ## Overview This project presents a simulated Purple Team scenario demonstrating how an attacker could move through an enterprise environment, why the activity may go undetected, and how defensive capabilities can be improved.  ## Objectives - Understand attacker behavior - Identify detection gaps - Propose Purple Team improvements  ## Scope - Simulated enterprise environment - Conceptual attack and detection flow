# From Breach to Detection – Purple Team Simulation

## Attack Scenario
An attacker gains initial access through compromised user credentials
obtained via phishing.
The attacker then moves laterally to access additional systems
and attempts privilege escalation.

## Detection Gaps
- Limited monitoring of authentication anomalies
- Insufficient alerting for lateral movement
- Delayed detection of privilege escalation attempts

## Blue Team Perspective
The security team lacks visibility into early-stage attacker behavior,
resulting in delayed response and increased attacker dwell time.

## Purple Team Improvements
- Implement improved authentication logging and anomaly detection
- Enhance visibility into lateral movement techniques
- Conduct Purple Team exercises to align detection with real attack paths

## Outcome
Improving collaboration between offensive and defensive teams
reduces detection time and strengthens organizational security posture.
