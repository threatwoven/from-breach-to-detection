# From Breach to Detection (Purple Team Simulation)

## Overview
This project presents a simulated Purple Team scenario
demonstrating how an attacker could move through an enterprise environment,
why the activity may go undetected, and how defensive capabilities can be improved.

## Objectives
- Understand attacker behavior
- Identify detection gaps
- Propose Purple Team improvements

## Scope
- Simulated enterprise environment
- Conceptual attack and detection flow
