## Overview
This project presents a simulated Purple Team scenario
demonstrating how an attacker could move through an enterprise environment,
why the activity may go undetected, and how defensive capabilities can be improved.

## Objectives
- Understand attacker behavior
- Identify detection gaps
- Propose Purple Team improvements

## Scope
- Simulated enterprise environment
  
## Project Purpose
This project demonstrates a purple team mindset by mapping
realistic attack paths to detection gaps and improvement opportunities.
